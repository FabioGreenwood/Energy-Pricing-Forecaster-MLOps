# Energy-Pricing-Forecaster-MLOps
A data engineering project that aims to answer the question:
"Is energy cheaper on warm or windy days?"
Our role as data engineers is to collect and clean data to try to answer the question.

As an extension, we use machine learning and the cloud (AWS) to forecast future energy prices based on historic data and machine learning automatically.
